# VAkE
The VAkE is a versatile next generation controller board that can be used for a 3D printer, CNC router, engraver.  It's build around a powerfull 32-bit STM32F446 MCU. If this wouldn't be enough for your project, you can use the Raspberry Pi header to seamless add a Pi of your choice. Don't bother about the interconnects or power supply, they are all provided for you. You only have to marry both boards.
